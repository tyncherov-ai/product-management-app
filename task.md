# Technical Specification: Product Management Platform

## Project Description

Create a web application that combines user authentication with product management. Users can register/login to access a products dashboard where they can view, create, edit, and delete products using a real REST API. The platform provides a complete CRUD interface with detailed product views.

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Styling**: Your choice (Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Styled Components)
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux Toolkit
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Authentication**: Local/Session Storage + JWT-like tokens

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication System

- Login Page with email/password fields
- Registration Page with form validation
- Protected Routes - redirect to login if not authenticated
- User Session Management - persist login state
- Logout functionality with session cleanup

### 2. Products Dashboard

- Products List - grid/table view of all products
- Search and Filter functionality
- Pagination for large product lists
- Add New Product button
- Product Cards showing:
  - Product name
  - Price (if available)
  - Image placeholder
  - Key specifications

### 3. Product Detail Page

- Full product information display
- Edit Product functionality
- Delete Product with confirmation
- Navigation back to products list
- Related products suggestions (optional)

### 4. Product Management

- Create Product - form with validation
- Edit Product - pre-filled form with update capability
- Delete Product - confirmation modal
- Real-time updates - refresh data after operations

## API Integration

### Primary API - Restful API Dev

**Base URL**: `https://api.restful-api.dev/objects`

### Available Endpoints:

```http
// Get all products
GET https://api.restful-api.dev/objects

// Get specific product
GET https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/{id}

// Delete product
DELETE https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/{id}
```

```http
// Create new product
POST https://api.restful-api.dev/objects
Body: {
  "name": "Product Name",
  "data": {
    "price": 299.99,
    "color": "Black",
    "category": "Electronics"
  }
}

// Update product
PUT https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/{id}
Body: {
  "name": "Updated Product Name",
  "data": {
    "price": 349.99,
    "color": "White",
    "category": "Electronics"
  }
}
```

## Mock Authentication API

Since the restful-api.dev doesn't include authentication, we'll simulate it:

```javascript
// Mock authentication endpoints (stored in localStorage)
const authAPI = {
  login: (email, password) => Promise,
  register: (email, password, name) => Promise,
  logout: () => void,
  getCurrentUser: () => User | null
};
```

## Technical Details

### Required Components

1.  **AuthProvider** - Authentication context provider
2.  **LoginForm** - User login component
3.  **RegisterForm** - User registration component
4.  **ProtectedRoute** - Route guard component
5.  **ProductsList** - Products grid/list view
6.  **ProductCard** - Individual product display
7.  **ProductDetail** - Detailed product view
8.  **ProductForm** - Create/edit product form
9.  **SearchBar** - Product search functionality
10. **Pagination** - Page navigation component
11. **LoadingSpinner** - Loading state indicator
12. **ConfirmModal** - Delete confirmation dialog
13. **Header** - Navigation with user menu
14. **ErrorBoundary** - Error handling component

### Routes Structure

```jsx
const routes = [
  { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
  { path: "/login", element: <LoginPage /> },
  { path: "/register", element: <RegisterPage /> },
  {
    path: "/dashboard",
    element: (
      <ProtectedRoute>
        <ProductsDashboard />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/products/:id",
    element: (
      <ProtectedRoute>
        <ProductDetail />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/products/new",
    element: (
      <ProtectedRoute>
        <CreateProduct />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/products/:id/edit",
    element: (
      <ProtectedRoute>
        <EditProduct />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    ),
  },
];
```

## State Management

### Authentication Flow:

1.  User submits login/register form
2.  Store user data in localStorage/sessionStorage
3.  Update global auth state
4.  Redirect to dashboard

### Products Flow:

1.  Fetch products from API on dashboard load
2.  Handle CRUD operations with optimistic updates
3.  Show loading states during API calls
4.  Handle errors with user-friendly messages

## Form Validations

```javascript
// Login Form Validation
const loginSchema = {
  email: {
    required: true,
    pattern: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
  },
  password: {
    required: true,
    minLength: 6,
  },
};

// Product Form Validation
const productSchema = {
  name: {
    required: true,
    minLength: 3,
    maxLength: 100,
  },
  price: {
    type: "number",
    min: 0,
  },
  category: {
    required: true,
  },
};
```
